# Lab 8: Software Design

{: .no_toc }
Due at 2:30 PM on April 4, 2024
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Getting the Starter Code

Navigate to the directory where you would like to store the code for this lab. Run the following commands to install the lab starter code or download it manually [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/t48cyvtu5wqhlmu8q445f/Lab8.tar.gz?rlkey=4l0fp997i3uhqw7qi13tiz7hs&st=7c20rx3m&dl=0).

```bash
wget "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/t48cyvtu5wqhlmu8q445f/Lab8.tar.gz?rlkey=4l0fp997i3uhqw7qi13tiz7hs&st=7c20rx3m&dl=0" -O lab8.tar.gz
tar -xf lab8.tar.gz
rm lab8.tar.gz
```

It is _strongly_ recommended to use GitHub to track the changes made to your lab assignment. First, create a new **private** repository in GitHub. Then, navigate to the lab assignment directory and run the following commands.

```bash
git init
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin [LINK TO REPO]
git push -u origin main
```

This will establish a main branch on the remote repository and add the starter code as the first commit.

Instructions for labs will be presented in person. Lab assignments are meant to be completed during lab time and are due at the end of the session. The late policy will apply to lab assignments submitted after the deadline.
