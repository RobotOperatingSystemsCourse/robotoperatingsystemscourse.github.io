## Getting the Starter Code
Navigate to the directory where you would like to store the code for this project. Run the following commands to install the project starter code or download it manually [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/etrwf6zy7rsdp63xbak2e/Project4.tar.gz?rlkey=2nw0w1w7fympk0vtxz3o1z8n6&st=e644x1rz&dl=0).
```bash
wget "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/etrwf6zy7rsdp63xbak2e/Project4.tar.gz?rlkey=2nw0w1w7fympk0vtxz3o1z8n6&st=e644x1rz&dl=0" -O p3.tar.gz
tar -xf p3.tar.gz
rm p3.tar.gz
```

It is *strongly* recommended to use GitHub to track the changes made to your project. First, create a new **private** repository in GitHub. Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following commands.
```bash
git init
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin [LINK TO REPO]
git push -u origin main
```
This will establish a main branch on the remote repository and add the starter code as the first commit.
